Week by week Building Microservices builds on the previous weeks code teaching you how to build a multi-tier microservice system. The code structure for the course is one of a mono repo. To make it simple to follow along, each episode has its own branch showing progress to date. 

## Series Content:

Over the weeks we will look at the following topics, teaching you everything you need to know regarding building microservices with the go programming language:

- Introduction to microservices
- RESTFul microservices
- gRPC microservices
- Packaging applications with Docker
- Testing microservice
- Continuous Delivery
- Observability
- Using Kubernetes
- Debugging
- Security
- Asynchronous microservices
- Caching
- Microservice reliability using a Service Mesh

### Branch: [episode_2](https://github.com/nicholasjackson/building-microservices-youtube/tree/episode_2)

In this episode we learn more about the standard library and look at how we can refactor last episodes example into a reusable microservice pattern.


## Episode 3 - RESTFul microservices

### [https://youtu.be/eBeqtmrvVpg](https://youtu.be/eBeqtmrvVpg)

### Branch: [episode_3](https://github.com/nicholasjackson/building-microservices-youtube/tree/episode_3)

In this episode we start to learn about RESTFul services and reading and writing data using the JSON format.


## Episode 4 - RESTful microservices

### [https://youtu.be/UZbHLVsjpF0](https://youtu.be/UZbHLVsjpF0)

### Branch [episode_4](https://github.com/nicholasjackson/building-microservices-youtube/tree/episode_4)

We continue to look at how you can implement RESTFul services with the Standard API


## Episode 5 - Gorilla toolkit

### Branch [episode_5](https://github.com/nicholasjackson/building-microservices-youtube/tree/episode_5)

In this epsode we refactor our Standard library RESTful service and start to implement the Gorill toolkit for routing.
